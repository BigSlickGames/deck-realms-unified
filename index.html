          <h1>Deck Realms: Factions at War – The Story Begins</h1>

          <p>
            Long before the war, the Realm of Decks thrived in harmony.<br />
            Four great Spires rose across the lands — monuments of life, energy,
            and balance.<br />
            Each pulsed with a different essence: Love, Honor, Might, and
            Foresight.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The Hearts</strong>, guided by the warmth of compassion,
            healed wounds both seen and unseen.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The Spades</strong>, noble and disciplined, upheld the
            realm's laws and defended the innocent.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The Clubs</strong>, forged in shadow and fire, thrived on
            survival, chaos, and strength.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The Diamonds</strong>, keepers of time and truth, watched
            over destiny itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each faction guarded its Spire with four Councils — North, South,
            East, and West — thirteen warriors each, from the humble Two to the
            exalted Ace.<br />
            Together, they were the Deck, and for centuries, their order held
            the balance of the Realms.
          </p>

          <h2>The Shattering</h2>

          <p>
            No one knows who struck first.<br />
            Some say a Club brute marched on the borders of Heart's Vale.<br />
            Others whisper of a Diamond Seer who saw too far into a future she
            could not change.<br />
            But all agree on one thing:<br />
            When the Diamond Spire shattered, the balance of fate was torn
            apart.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fragments of time scattered through the land, twisting reality.<br />
            What was once predictable became chaos.<br />
            Old alliances faltered. Trust decayed.<br />
            And from the cracks of madness, the Jokers emerged — four beings
            born of disorder, mocking every law and rule that once bound the
            Realms together.
          </p>

          <p>
            They spread deceit like wildfire, pitting Faction against Faction,
            Spire against Spire.<br />
            Love turned to jealousy. Honor to arrogance. Strength to cruelty.<br />
            Even the Diamonds, seers of truth, could no longer see a single
            clear path.
          </p>

          <h2>The War of the Deck</h2>

          <p>Now, the Four Factions stand on the brink of annihilation.</p>

          <p>
            <strong>The Hearts</strong> fight to heal what's left of the realm,
            their compassion hardening into fierce protection.<br />
            <strong>The Spades</strong> wage war for honor, believing only
            through discipline can order return.<br />
            <strong>The Clubs</strong> march to consume all — chaos is their
            creed, and they will forge a new world from the ashes.<br />
            <strong>The Diamonds</strong> seek fragments of their broken Spire,
            desperate to weave time together before it unravels completely.
          </p>

          <p>
            And in the shadows, the Jokers laugh — twisting fate, shifting
            sides, ensuring that no Faction ever truly wins.
          </p>

          <h2>The Game Begins</h2>

          <p>
            In <strong>Deck Realms: Factions at War</strong>, you enter this
            world as a soldier of one of the Four Factions.<br />
            Your rank defines your strength.<br />
            Your allegiance defines your purpose.<br />
            Your choices — and the alliances you forge — will decide the future
            of the Realms.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Spires are flickering.<br />
            The Councils are divided.<br />
            And somewhere, the Jokers are watching… waiting for their next move.
          </p>

          <p class="story-ending">
            Because in Deck Realms — even the deck itself can turn against you.
